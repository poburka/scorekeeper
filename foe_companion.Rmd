The Functions of Exercise Scale was developed by Patricia Marten DiBartolo, Linda Lin, Simone Montoya, Heather Neal, and Carey Shaffer. The scale includes two subscales: Weight and Appearance (WA), and Health and Enjoyment (HE). The FES is a 16-item, self-report questionnaire that assesses motivation to exercise. Individuals provide ratings using a 7-item scale from “1 = do not agree” to “7 = strongly agree". FES-HE scores are positively correlated with psychological well-being and physical health. Conversely, FES-WA scores are negatively correlated with depressive and eating disorder symptoms, self-esteem, and physical well-being.
